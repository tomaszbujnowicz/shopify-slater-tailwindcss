# Important note: Working on updated version of the boilerplate.

You might find this starter theme a little outdated and I am going to archive it soon.

The new starter theme will be based on some theme functionality from original Slater repo (including fixes/adjustments from issues and pull requests).

What's more important, It'll work without the complex setup from Slater and instead it'll be based on:

* Laravel Mix 6
* TailwindCSS 2
* and original Shopify Theme Kit for quick updates

Stay tuned âœŒ

# ðŸš€ Shopify Starter Theme + TailwindCSS with PurgeCSS

**First of all, big thank your for guys at The Couch for creating Shopify development toolkit called [Slater](https://github.com/the-couch/slater)**

I wanted to use Slater and TailwindCSS but couldn't make that work together. I had a project on the table with a start date NOW and decided to create this little temporary monster.

I took the [Slater theme](https://github.com/the-couch/slater), integrated it with TailwindCSS + PurgeCSS and rewrite most of the markup to use css classes from TailwindCSS.

Note: the theme needs some love and it's still work in progress.
